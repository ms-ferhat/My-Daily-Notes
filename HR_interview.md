##### Tell me about yourself

**I'm currently in my final year of Communication Engineering at Fayoum University, with a strong interest in cybersecurity, particularly in the field of digital forensics. I'm currently preparing for the eCDFP certification exam to deepen my expertise.**

**I'm excited about this opportunity at Concentrix because I believe it will provide me with valuable experience in a professional environment, help me enhance my communication and problem-solving skills, and serve as a significant step forward in building my career.**


##### Where you see yourself after 5 years?

**In the first couple of years, I aim to gain valuable experience and enhance my skills, with the goal of joining a leading company in the field of digital forensics, such as CyShield, EG-CERT, or even the security team here at Concentrix.**

**Looking further ahead, in five years, I plan to move beyond the junior level and establish myself as a mid-senior professional in digital forensics. During this time, I also aspire to pursue advanced certifications in the field, such as the GCFA from SANS, to deepen my expertise and stay at the forefront of the industry.**

##### did you have experience in Customer Service?

**While I donâ€™t have direct experience in a formal customer service role, I understand that key skills for this field include strong communication and problem-solving abilities. I have actively developed these skills during my academic journey, particularly through my involvement in IEEE activities, where I collaborated with diverse teams, organized events, and addressed challenges effectively.**

**These experiences have taught me how to communicate clearly, understand different perspectives, and find solutions, which I believe will help me excel in a customer service role.__**
