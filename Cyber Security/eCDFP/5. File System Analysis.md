# File Allocation Table (FAT)

FAT file system has some version like FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 and exFAT, the number of all of them refer to the __Cluster__ size.

> [!info] __Cluster__
> The Smallest logical unit file system can allocate to file, Cluster could be 512 byte up to file system size.
> 

> __#of the sector per cluster ---> Boot Record__


When you choose the number of __sector__ per __Cluster__ note that, The big cluster lead to __waste of the space__, The small cluster lead to __overhead__.

## FAT Structure

Any FAT file system content three main areas.
- __Reserved Area__
- __FAT Area__ 
- __Data Area__

### Reserved Area

For FAT12, FAT16 Reserved Area is 1 Sector only Content __Boot Sector__, And For FAT32 Reserved Area is __32 Sectors__ content __Boot Sector + FSINFO + Boot Strap + Reserved Sector__.

#### Boot Sector

#### File System Information (FSINFO)

Last thing about __Reserved Area__ is that boot strap section end with 0x55AA.



### FAT Area

For both FAT12 and FAT16 is just one Area, But for FAT32 is two areas. The length of the FAT area depend on the type of FAT, 12 cluster for FAT12, 16 cluster for FAT16 and 28 cluster for FAT32 as there are four cluster is reserved.

Frist used cluster is number 2, As 0 and 1 is reserved. ONE for __Media Descriptor__ and Two for __Dirty Volume Management__.


__How to Find FAT#1 Area__
1. Go to Boot Sector
2. Check the "No. of the Sectors"
3. Go to Sector value for FAT#1

### Data Area

Both Reserved and FAT area call System area, and the next one call __Data Area__ that hold all files and directories, Directories is a special type of files, that hold files names and metadata.

# NTFS

NTFS have a lot of feature over the previous one like Journaling, ADS, Hard link and more, we will discuss these Feature more.

> [!info] __Journaling__
> Mean that file system used a log file ($logfile) to store all metadata change.


Every thing with NTFS is file, NTFS used some metadata files to __Implement__ the file system.

## Structure

As we say NTFS used some metadata files to implement the file system, the most important file is __Master File Table(MFT)__, MFT is an array of records. each file in NTFS has one or more record in MFT.

> [!info] __MFT Zone__
> is the space reserved for the MFT from the disk, be default it is 12.5% of the disk.

![[Pasted image 20250128200539.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250128200545.png]]

__Volume Boot Record (VBR) $Boot__: this metadata file is hold the location of MFT, and it was always locate at the start of the file system.




## Attributes

> [!info] __Resident Attributes__
> The attributes that have header and it's content come directly after it, file size less than 700 byte

> [!info] __Non_resident Attributes__
> attributes are stored in sperate cluster of the disk, file size more than 700 byte.
>

![[Pasted image 20250129195102.png]]__Resident Header__

![[Pasted image 20250129195117.png]]__Non_resident Header__

- __Virtual Cluster Number (VCN)__: descript sequence number of the cluster associated with a file.
- __Logical Cluster Number (LCN)__: this relative to the first cluster of the _VCN_.
- __Run list__: is a sequence of the cluster runs that contain the data for the file.
