# File Identification & Structure

## Steps of identify File
1. File Extension
2. File Structure 
3. Metadata
	1. MFT records
	2. File header
	3. Magic number


> PDF have a __header section__ __trailer section__ and also __XREF section.__
## Master File Table (MFT)

> MFT is used by NTFS to store the metadata. each file has a one or more MFT record

## Metadata

1. System metadata
2. Substantive metadata
3. Embedded metadata
4. External metadata

### System Metadata 
> Information create by OS to track and manage the files

__MAC__
- Create date: is the time when file create for first time
- Access date: is the time of last operation done on the file like open, copy or move
- Modified time: when the content of the file last change
- entry modified: is in NTFS

### Temp files
> is normally created and used be apps or OS for a short time

> app used temp file to track files. OS used temp file to dump and used process from RAM to disk this know as ==swapping==.


## Data hidden locations

1. Registry
2. Metadata of the file
3. ADS


# File analysis

## DOCX analysis

> DOC consist of many sections, 
1. like __Mainstream__ contain the file main data.
2. Summery section
3. Table stream

## JPEG analysis

> [!info] __JPEG__
> Joint Photographic Experts Groups

## PDF analysis

![[Pasted image 20250107080741.png]]

__Body__ Contain data of the file like (string, image and video).Different types of data called __Object__,
__Object__ in pdf start with ==obj==  and end with ==endobj==

![[Pasted image 20250107081119.png]]

__Stream__ series of objects belong to same entity, __Stream__ start with __stream__ end with __endstream__.

> for a optimization, streams are usually compressed in order.
