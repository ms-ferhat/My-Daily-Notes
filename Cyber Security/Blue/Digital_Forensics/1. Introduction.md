## Background
---

> __Digital Forensics__: is recovery and investigation of artifacts found in digital devices.

__The big goal of DF is to answer the five W__
1. what
2. where
3. when
4. who
5. how

## Fundamentals

## Digital Evidence

> __Evidence__ : is any digital information that store , transmitted or produce by digital device.

__Life Cycle__
1. Acquisition
2. Analysis
3. Presentation

> __Acquisition__: the process of obtaining forensics image of evidence.

### Types & Source of Evidence

#### Types
- __Active data:__ include all data and file that create by OS or any another source.
- __Archive and backup:__ the data that organize and preserved for long term storage.
- __Hidden data:__
	- __meta data:__ Defined as data about data.
	- __Residual data:__ this is the delete data on the disk.
	- __Replicant data:__ this type is generate when program like word processor create a copy of opened file (e.g. & web cache and temporary dictionary )

#### Sources
- Computer devices
- Storage devices
- Removable media
- Thumb driver
- Memory cards


### Tools
