# File Allocation Table (FAT)

FAT file system has some version like FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 and exFAT, the number of all of them refer to the __Cluster__ size.

FAT32 has a file size limit of 4GB and a volume limit of 2TB.

> [!info] __Cluster__
> The Smallest logical unit file system can allocate to file, Cluster could be 512 byte up to file system size.
> 

> __#of the sector per cluster ---> Boot Record__


When you choose the number of __sector__ per __Cluster__ note that, The big cluster lead to __waste of the space__, The small cluster lead to __overhead__.

## FAT Structure

Any FAT file system content three main areas.
- __Reserved Area__
- __FAT Area__ 
- __Data Area__

### Reserved Area

For FAT12, FAT16 Reserved Area is 1 Sector only Content __Boot Sector__, And For FAT32 Reserved Area is __32 Sectors__ content __1.Boot Sector, 2.FSINFO, 3.Boot Strap, 4.Reserved Sector__.

The reserved sector always starts from sector 0 on the partition on the partition and includes:
- Boot sector
- FSinfo sector
- Backup boot sector
- Additional reserved sectors

#### Boot Sector

#### File System Information (FSINFO)

![[Pasted image 20250126201148.png]]



Last thing about __Reserved Area__ is that boot strap section end with 0x55AA.



### FAT Area

For both FAT12 and FAT16 is just one Area, But for FAT32 is two areas. The length of the FAT area depend on the type of FAT, 12 cluster for FAT12, 16 cluster for FAT16 and 28 cluster for FAT32 as there are four cluster is reserved.

__Importance of Fat area__
- It contains information about the allocation of clusters to a file or directory and the next free clusters.
- It helps with the fragmentation (data stored in non-contiguous clusters) of files. It keeps track of all the clusters that are assigned to a file.
- It does integrity checking to identify bad clusters and mark them not to be used for storing data. Each entry in the FAT is 32 bits, but only 28 bits are effectively used. It is this 32-bit value that is referenced in the filesystem name FAT **32** .

Frist used cluster is number 2, As 0 and 1 is reserved. ONE for __Media Descriptor__ and Two for __Dirty Volume Management__.


__How to Find FAT#1 Area__
1. Go to Boot Sector
2. Check the "No. of the Sectors"
3. Go to Sector value for FAT#1

### Data Area

Both Reserved and FAT area call System area, and the next one call __Data Area__ that hold all files and directories, Directories is a special type of files, that hold files names and metadata, contain:
- __Root Directory:__ Start from the 3th cluster, Contain both Long File Name (LFN) and Short File Name (SFN)
- Data Region

The first two clusters of the data area are reserved for system use. These two clusters are not physical clusters but virtual ones.

#### Long File Name

An LFN entry stores the name of a file. This type of format was implemented due to the limitations of the Short File Name format. A filename could only consist of 8 bytes for the filename, and 3 bytes for the extension. Each LFN entry has a corresponding SFN entry. A filename may be spread amongst multiple LFN entries. To keep track of this, a sequence number is used in the first byte. The first nibble indicates whether the entry is the last or if the entry has been deleted. The second nibble indicates the sequence number.

#### Short File Name

A SFN entry stores a file’s attributes and its starting cluster. This value is then used to find its corresponding FAT entry.

## Filesystem Analysis Techniques

### Filesystem Integrity and Structural Analysis
This category focuses on detecting corruption, tampering, and anomalies in the filesystem by analyzing its metadata, structural consistency, and organization.

![[Pasted image 20250223201451.png]]

### Data Recovery and Content Analysis
This category focuses on recovering deleted or hidden data, checking data in allocated and unallocated spaces, and searching for specific content patterns.

## FAT32 Attacks
you can see MITRE ATT&CK techniques that apply to FAT32. Most of these techniques are related to the tactic TA0005 Defense Evasion. The following tasks will show some of these techniques in deeper detail.

# NTFS

NTFS have a lot of feature over the previous one like Journaling, ADS, Hard link and more, we will discuss these Feature more.

> [!info] __Journaling__
> Mean that file system used a log file ($logfile) to store all metadata change.


Every thing with NTFS is file, NTFS used some metadata files to __Implement__ the file system.

## Structure

As we say NTFS used some metadata files to implement the file system, the most important file is __Master File Table(MFT)__, MFT is an array of records. each file in NTFS has one or more record in MFT.

> [!info] __MFT Zone__
> is the space reserved for the MFT from the disk, be default it is 12.5% of the disk.

![[Pasted image 20250128200539.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250128200545.png]]

__Volume Boot Record (VBR) $Boot__: this metadata file is hold the location of MFT, and it was always locate at the start of the file system.




## Attributes

> [!info] __Resident Attributes__
> The attributes that have header and it's content come directly after it, file size less than 700 byte

> [!info] __Non_resident Attributes__
> attributes are stored in sperate cluster of the disk, file size more than 700 byte.
>

![[Pasted image 20250129195102.png]]__Resident Header__

![[Pasted image 20250129195117.png]]__Non_resident Header__

- __Virtual Cluster Number (VCN)__: descript sequence number of the cluster associated with a file.
- __Logical Cluster Number (LCN)__: this relative to the first cluster of the _VCN_.
- __Run list__: is a sequence of the cluster runs that contain the data for the file.
