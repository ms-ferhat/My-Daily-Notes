## Hard Disk Driver (HDD)

> [!info] __Hard Disk__
> is a storage unit the used magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital data.
> 

#### Characteristics of HDD
1. __platter__: store digital data
2. __spindle__: used to mount platters and spin them.
3. __Head__: used to read and write on platter.
4. __IDE Connector__: used to connect HDD to main board.

Each platter dive to number of __tracks__, Each track dive to number of __section__, Most HDD has logical sector size __512-byte__, Except __Advance format (AF)__ has size of __4096__.

> sector size this the smallest amount of data could read or write by HDD.

> [!equation] __equation__
> Disk Capacity = N_cylinders x N_Heads x N_sector x Sector_size.

## Addressing in HDD

### 1. Cylinder Head Sector (CHS)

> the addressing is based on geometry of the cylinder, Head and sector.

for example (0,0,1)
- cylinder --> 0 ---> used 10- bits
- head ---> 0 ----> used 8-bit
- section ---> 1 ----> used 6-bit
__note that section start from 1 not 0__


### 2. Logical Block Addressing (LBA)

> LBA used a single number to address each sector.

> [!info] __Equation__
> LBA address = ((( Cylinder x HeadperCylinder) + Head) x SectorPerHead) + Sector -1

# Solid State Drive (SSD)

> [!info] __SSD__
> is a electronics Driver used flash NAND in most cases

- __Page__: is the smallest unit could read or write in __SSD__, 4KB
- __Block__ is group of pages and the smallest unit could erase in __SSD__, 128 pages
- __Plan__: is group of blocks.

# Volumes & Partitions

> [!info] __Volume__
> collection of sectors not physically contiguous, but they logically consequential.

> [!info] __Partition__
> Collection of sectors that are physically contiguous.


# Disk Partitioning

## IBM DOS

> Used address table in MBR to show Partitions.


__MBR Structure__

| Block           | Size(byte) |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Bootcode        | 446        |
| Partition Table | 64         |
| Signature       | 2          |

__Partition Table content four entry each one for one partition__

> Signature for MBR must be `55 AA`


__Layer of analysis disk and file system__

4. Apps and OS
