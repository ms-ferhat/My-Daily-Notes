| **Component**      | **Description**                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crypter**        | Encrypts or wraps malware to conceal it from reverse engineering, analysis, and antivirus detection      |
| **Downloader**     | Trojan that fetches additional malware or malicious code from the Internet upon infection                |
| **Dropper**        | Covertly installs malware payloads onto target systems, bypassing detection                              |
| **Exploit**        | Malicious code that leverages vulnerabilities to breach security and inject malware                      |
| **Injector**       | Injects malicious code into running processes for persistence and stealth                                |
| **Obfuscator**     | Alters or scrambles code logic to evade signature-based detection                                        |
| **Packer**         | Bundles and compresses malware files into a single executable to bypass scanners                         |
| **Payload**        | The functional component that executes the intended malicious action (e.g., backdoor, data exfiltration) |
| **Malicious Code** | Core instructions implementing malicious functions like stealing data or creating backdoors              |

## Prepare Malware Incident

## Detection & analysis

### Indications of Malware

- **Sluggish performance, high CPU/RAM usage**
- **Frequent crashes, freezes, blue screens, or unexpected reboots**
- **Unusual or excessive hard‑drive activity** even at idle 
- **Unexplained network traffic or high bandwidth use** when not actively transmitting data 
- **Antivirus/firewall disabled or blocked from updating**
- **Task Manager, Control Panel or system tools disabled**
- **Excessive pop‑ups, ads, or fake alerts** 
- **Browser homepage/search engine hijacked**, new toolbars/extensions installed
- **Unexpected programs, icons or startup entries** appearing without consent 
- **Missing, corrupted, or encrypted files** (ransomware signs)


### Analysis

> [!info] **live system analysis**
> Monitoring all system activity(port, process, services, network connection, DNS and more) to check or ensure malware infection.
