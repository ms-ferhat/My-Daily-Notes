## What Is Microsoft Sentinel?

**Microsoft Sentinel's own definition becomes a combination of SIEM and SOAR. It is essentially a scalable, cloud-native solution that provides the following:**

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) functionality by:
    - Collecting and querying logs
    - Doing **correlation** or **anomaly detection**
    - Creating **alerts** and **incidents** based on findings
- Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) functionality by:
    - Defining playbooks
    - Automating threat responses
