## Phishing
**A phishing attack is a type of attack that usually aims to steal the user's personal information by tricking them into clicking on malicious links in emails or running malicious files on their computer.**

### ### E-mail Traffic Analysis

Many parameters are needed to analyze a phishing attack. The following parameters can give us an idea of the size of the attack and the target audience if we perform a search on the mail gateway.

- Sender Address(info@letsdefend.io)
- SMTP IP Address(127.0.0.1)
- @letsdefend.io (domain base)
- letsdefend (In addition to the Gmail account, the attacker may have sent from the Hotmail account)
- Subject (sender address and SMTP address may be constantly changing)

### Email Header

#### Important Fields

  
**From**  
  
The 'From' field in an Internet header shows the name and email address of the sender.  
  
**To**  
  
This field in the mail header contains the details of the recipient of the email, including their name and email address. Such as CC (carbon copy) and BCC (blind carbon copy) also fall under this category, as they all contain details of your recipients.  
  
To find out more about carbon copy and blind carbon copy, see How to use CC and BCC.  
  
**Date**  
  
This is the timestamp showing when the email was sent.  
  
In Gmail, it usually follows the format day dd month yyyy hh:mm:ss  
  
So if an email was sent on 16 November 2021 at 4:57:23 pm, it would show up as Wed, 16 Nov 2021 16:57:23.  
  
**Subject**  
  
The subject is the topic of the email. It summarises the content of the entire message body.  
  
**Return-Path**  
  
This email header field is also known as Reply-To. When you reply to an email, the reply is sent to the address specified in the Return-Path field.  
  
**Domain Key and DKIM Signatures**  
  
Domain Key and Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM) are email signatures that help email service providers identify and authenticate your emails, similar to SPF signatures.  
  
**Message-ID**  
  
The Message-ID header is a unique combination of letters and numbers that identifies each email. No two emails will have the same Message ID.  
  
**MIME-Version**  
  
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is an Internet coding standard. It converts non-text content, such as images, videos, and other attachments, into text so that non-text content can be attached to an email and sent via SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).  
  
**Received**  
  
The Received section lists each mail server that an email has passed through before arriving in the recipient's inbox. It's listed in reverse chronological order - the mail server at the top is the last server the email message passed through, and the mail server at the bottom is where the email originated.  
  
**X-Spam Status**  
  

The X-Spam Status shows you the spam score of an email message.  
First, it'll highlight if a message is classified as spam.  
It then shows the spam score of the email and the spam threshold for the email.  
An email can either meet or exceed an inbox's spam threshold. If it's too spammy and exceeds the threshold, it's automatically classified as spam and sent to the Spam folder.


### Email Header Analysis

- Was the email sent from the correct SMTP server?
- Are the data "From" and "Return-Path / Reply-To" the same?
these two question is the main question to analysis mail header.

**we could answer fist one by check received path and from address on mxtoolbox""
