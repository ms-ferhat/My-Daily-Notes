> Access control is a security mechanism used to control which users or systems are allowed to access a particular resource or system.

1. **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: In this type of access control, the resource owner or administrator determines who is allowed to access a resource and what actions they are allowed to perform.
2. **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: In this type of access control, access to resources is determined by a set of predefined rules or policies that are enforced by the system.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: In this type of access control, users are assigned roles that define their level of access to resources.
4. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: In this type of access control, access to resources is determined by a set of attributes, such as user role, time of day, location, and device. ABAC is commonly used in cloud environments and web applications.
