## Analog 
### **Basic Understanding**

1. **What is an analog signal?**
2. **Can you give some real-life examples of analog signals?** (e.g., sound, temperature, light)
3. **How is an analog signal different from a digital signal?**

### **Working with Analog Signals in Embedded Systems**

4. **Why do microcontrollers need an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)?**
5. **What is the purpose of a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)?**
6. **What are some common sensors that produce analog signals?** (e.g., temperature sensor, light sensor, microphone)

### **Practical Questions**

1. **If you measure a sensor's voltage and it keeps changing slightly, what could be the reason?** (Noise, interference, sensor sensitivity)
2. **How can we filter out unwanted noise in an analog signal?** (Using capacitors, low-pass filters, averaging readings)
3. **If an ADC has a resolution of 10 bits and a reference voltage of 5V, what is the smallest voltage change it can detect?** (Answer: 5V / 1024 = ~4.88mV)
