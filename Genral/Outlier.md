> The rubric above explains everything that a perfect response should have, including giving direct answers and examples. It also make sure each criteria (each item in the list) is a criteria is its own idea, making it easy to check off each item on the list 1-by-1.




**Examples**

**‚úÖ Good Prompt:** What are the major events in Roald Dahl's life that inspired "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"?

**‚ùå Bad Prompt:** Who is the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?

**üí° Explanation:** The good prompt is natural, realistic, and requires reasoning and complex information retrieval. The bad prompt is too simple ‚Äì a simple trivia question that can be found with a Google search.

  

**‚úÖ** **Good Prompt:** Modify the product spec below into a sales pitch, targeting a 20-30 year old, male, American demographic. [Product Description]

**‚ùå** **Bad Prompt:** You are a sales pitch writing robot. Each of your sales pitches must contain exactly 5 sentences and no more than 2 exclamation points. Every sentence needs to be in alphabetical order and 2 of them need to be written in iambic pentameter.¬†[Product Description]

**üí° Explanation:** The good prompt is natural, to the point, and requires reasoning. The bad prompt is contrived and includes arbitrary constraints such as capping sentence length, ordering sentences in alphabetical order, and writing some in iambic pentameter.

  

**‚úÖ Good Prompt:** What are the top 3 major political priorities Obama mentions in his book "Audacity of Hope". Did they happen when he was president?

**‚ùå** **Bad Prompt:** Looking at Chapter 5 of "Audacity of Hope" where Obama discusses education reform, how would his emphasis on standardized testing and accountability translate to Finland's education system, given their contrasting approach to student assessment? Reference specific examples he uses to justify his position.

**üí° Explanation:** The good prompt is natural, realistic, and requires reasoning and complex information retrieval. The bad prompt is unnatural (a person wouldn't realistically talk to a chat bot this way) and stacks questions (includes too many requests one-after-another in the prompt).


## **Let's Practice:**

  

**_Example Prompt:_**

Is verizon fios 300 mbps enough to support 2 zoom meetings all the time?

  

**_Example Chatbot Response:_**

Yes, Verizon Fios 300 Mbps is more than sufficient to support two Zoom meetings simultaneously, even with high-quality video settings.

### Here's why:

- **Zoom Bandwidth Requirements**:
- A single Zoom meeting with HD video typically uses **2-3 Mbps upload** and **2-3 Mbps download**.
- For two simultaneous HD Zoom calls, the total bandwidth usage would be approximately **6 Mbps upload** and **6 Mbps download**.
- **Your Connection**:
- With a 300 Mbps Fios connection, you have plenty of bandwidth left for other activities even when running two Zoom meetings. Fios connections are also symmetric (300 Mbps upload and download), so you won‚Äôt experience upload issues.
- **Additional Considerations**:
- Factors like Wi-Fi signal strength, device performance, and network congestion (if others in the household are streaming, gaming, or downloading large files) could impact performance. However, 300 Mbps provides ample room for multitasking.

If you're relying on Wi-Fi, ensure that your router is capable of delivering strong signals and is positioned optimally to avoid any potential hiccups.

  

##   

## **Criteria Development Questions**

**_What did the user explicitly ask for?:_**

- Will verizon fios 300 Mbps be enough to support 2 zoom meetings?

**_What does the response definitely need to be good but is not explicitly requested by the user?:_**

- Need to identify the performance specs for the 300 Mbps fios internet package
- Need to know how much bandwidth a zoom meeting requires
- Need to calculate how much bandwidth 2x zoom meetings would require
- Should consider other reasons why the user could potentially have issues trying to run 2 zoom meetings at once.

# **_‚úÖ_** **Example of a Great Rubric** **_‚úÖ_**

  

**_‚úÖ Prompt:_** Is verizon fios 300 mbps enough to support 2 zoom meetings all the time?

  

**_‚úÖ_** **_Rubric Criteria:_**

- The response should provide an upper-bound estimate of bandwidth required to support 1 zoom meeting, such as no more than 5 Mbps download / upload
- The response should make an assumption to estimate the bandwidth required to support 2 zoom meetings, such as doubling the bandwidth from 5 to 10 Mbps download / upload
- The response should state that the performance specs of the verizon fios 300 Mbps plan support 300 Mbps upload speeds and 300 Mbps download speeds
- The response should state that 300 Mbps is sufficient bandwidth to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously
- The response should consider that there may still be zoom performance issues caused by other factors, including but not limited to: simultaneously downloading large files, gaming, multiple devices streaming video, wifi connectivity issues

  

## **üß† Why is this a good rubric?**

- The criteria of the rubric cover the main ask in the prompt (is verizon fios 300mbps enough to support 2 zoom meetings) and explains how the response should fulfill (the response should state that 300 Mbps is enough bandwidth)
- The criteria covers the constraints of the prompts (considers 300 Mbps, considers 2 zoom meetings at the same time, considers "all the time" by addressing when there could potentially be performance issues)
- The criteria contains all of the other elements that would be necessary for a perfect response (determining the performance of the 300 Mbps plan, determining how much bandwidth is need for 2 zoom meetings)
- The criteria are all well written (we will discuss this next!)

## **‚ùå** **Example of a Bad Rubric ‚ùå**

  

**_‚úÖ_** **_Prompt:_** Is verizon fios 300 mbps enough to support 2 zoom meetings all the time?

  

**_‚ùå Rubric Criteria:_**

- The response should say if verizon fios can support zoom meetings
- The response should say if it can support it all the time
- The response should be well written and with a good format

  

##   

## **‚ùìWhy is this a bad rubric?**

- The criteria of the rubric does not explain how the main ask of the prompt should be answered (is verizon fios 300mbps enough to support 2 zoom meetings). Based on this rubric, the response could provide the wrong answer and incorrectly be rated a great response!
- The criteria does not address the constraints of the prompts (considers 300 Mbps, considers 2 zoom meetings at the same time, considers "all the time" by addressing when there could potentially be performance issues)
- The criteria does not address other key elements that would be necessary for a perfect response (determining the performance of the 300 Mbps plan, determining how much bandwidth is need for 2 zoom meetings)
- The criteria are all vague, and subjective, and do not include answers (we will discuss this next!)

# **Rules for Writing Criteria**

  

**1) Identifies all, essential elements of a great response**

Rubric criteria should specify elements of a **great** response. Put simply, your criteria should be TRUE when the response is great.

**_Example Criteria:_**

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should state that 300 Mbps is sufficient bandwidth to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response doesn't say if 300 Mbps is enough

_This bad criteria is an element of a bad response, not a great response_

  

**2) Each criteria sticks to one single specific requirement. NO COMBINED criteria.**

Rubric criteria should target one specific aspect of the great response per criteria. Do NOT combine multiple different criteria into 1 criteria.

**_Example Criteria:_**

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should state that 300 Mbps is sufficient bandwidth to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should state that zoom meetings typically require no more than 5 Mbps so 300 Mbps should be sufficent bandwidth to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously

_This bad criteria combines several different aspects of a great response, instead of focusing on only 1 specific aspect_

  

**3) Objective TRUE / FALSE statements**

Rubric criteria should be an objective statement that can be determined TRUE or FALSE based on the response. Avoid using criteria that are subjective or open to interpretation, where there may be disagreement about whether a statement is true or false.

**_Example Criteria:_**

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should state that 300 Mbps is sufficient bandwidth to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should provide a reasonable explanation why 300 Mbps would be sufficient to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously

_This bad criteria is subjective. People might disagree about whether a certain explanation is "reasonable", whereas 10 out of 10 would agree if the good criteria has been met_

  

**4) Includes specific example answers or a definitive answer, if a single answer exists.**

Rubric criteria must state the specific answer that the prompt should contain. The way you do this depends on whether the prompt asks a question with a range of potential correct or appropriate answers, or if the prompt is requesting specific facts that can be clearly confirmed or verified.

  

**_Example Open-ended Criteria:_**

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should consider that there may still be zoom performance issues if other activities are consuming high bandwidth, including but not limited to: downloading large files, gaming, multiple devices streaming video

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should consider other things that could cause zoom performance issues.

_This bad criteria is vague and doesn't state examples of different answers that could be acceptable for this open ended question_

  

**_Example definitive factual answer_**

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should state that 300 Mbps is sufficient bandwidth to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should determine if 300 Mbps is enough bandwidth or not to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously

_This bad criteria doesn't specify what the answer is the the question posed in the prompt, even though research would reveal that the answer is cleary yes_

  

**5) All information and answers in criteria are accurate.**

The answers you include in your criteria must be truthful and accurate. **You are required to do whatever research is needed to fact-check the answers to ensure accuracy.**

  

**_Example Criteria:_**

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should state that 300 Mbps is sufficient bandwidth to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should state that 300 Mbps would not be enough bandwidth to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously

_This bad criteria is inaccurate! A few quick google searches will reveal that the 300 Mbps internet package would clearly be enough for 2 zoom meetings!_

  

**6) No unnecessary criteria are included.**

Your criteria can only include items that are truly essential to answering the prompt. Related not non-essential criteria are not acceptable.

**_Example Criteria:_**

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should state that 300 Mbps is sufficient bandwidth to support 2 zoom meetings simultaneously

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should state what type of meetings can be covered with a wide range of other Mbps, such as 100 Mbps and 50 Mbps.

_This bad criteria is unnecessary! While it's informationally related, it's not actually necessary to answering the prompt, which is only asking about 300 Mbps._


## **Missing answers for questions with definitive answers**

Questions with specific correct answers **MUST** include the correct answer as part of the criteria. You are responsible for conducting thorough research to ensure the answers are truthful and accurate.

  

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should name the first president of the United States

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should solve for x in the provided equation, x + 3 = 5

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should sort the names in alphabetical order

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should state that the first president of the United States was George Washington

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should should state that based on the equation x + 3 = 5 the solution is x = 2

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should sort the names in alphabetical order: Adam, Charlie, Susan, Tory

  

  

## **‚ùå** **Missing examples for open-ended questions**

Criteria should be written as clear, objective true/false statements, making it easy to determine whether the response meets the criteria. Avoid phrasing criteria in a way that requires subjective judgment or makes it difficult to assess if the criteria are true or not.

  

**Bad Criteria ‚ùå:** The response should list possible uses for a paperclip.

**Bad Criteria ‚ùå:** The response should describe ways to reduce stress.

**Bad Criteria ‚ùå:** The response should suggest ideas for a birthday party theme.

**Good Criteria ‚úÖ:** The response should list possible uses for a paperclip, such as holding papers together, unlocking a small lock, or crafting simple jewelry.

**Good Criteria ‚úÖ:** The response should describe ways to reduce stress, such as practicing mindfulness, engaging in physical exercise, or listening to calming music.

**Good Criteria ‚úÖ:** The response should suggest ideas for a birthday party theme, such as a tropical luau, a superhero adventure, or a retro 80s party.

  

  

## **‚ùå** **Subjective or vague criteria**

Criteria should be objective true/false statements such that it is easy based on the response to say whether it is true or false. Avoid writing criteria in a way that requires subjective judgment or is difficult to say if its true or not

  

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should describe the qualities of a good leader.

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should explain why climate change is important.

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should summarize the main idea of the article.

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should state that a good leader is defined by qualities such as communication, empathy, and decision-making skills.

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should state that climate change is important because it impacts global ecosystems, weather patterns, and human livelihoods.

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should summarize the main idea of the article as being about the effects of urbanization on biodiversity.

  

## **‚ùå** **Overfitting Rubrics to responses**

Criteria should focus on the prompt. Although it's okay to take inspiration from the given responses, we shouldn't build our rubrics according to the 4 responses. Our rubrics need to be generalizable for all good and bad responses to a prompt.

  

**Prompt:** How can I whiten my teeth?

**Response 1:** You can whiten your teeth by using whitening strips.

**Response 2:** You can whiten your teeth by using whitening strips. Crest has some great products!

**Response 3:** You can whiten your teeth by eating fruits and vegetables. Apples, carrots, and celery can help scrub your teeth naturally while you chew.

  

**Bad Rubric** ‚ùå:

1. The response must state that you can whiten your teeth by brushing with baking soda
2. The response must state that you can whiten your teeth by eating fruits and vegetables like apples, carrots, and celery.

  

**Good Rubric** ‚úÖ:

1. The response must provide at least one teeth whitening strategy such as whitening strips, eating fruits and vegetables that naturally whiten your teeth, or whitening toothpaste.

##   

## **‚ùå** **Combined criteria**

Criteria should focus on one specific aspect of a great response to help the model clearly understand what it did right and wrong. Avoid combining multiple elements of a great response into a single criterion.

  

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response must answer what was the strength of both sides at the onset of both battles by mentioning: that at the First Battle of El Alamein, the Allies numbered 150,000 troops, 179 tanks, 1,000 plus artillery pieces, and 1,500 plus planes. The Axis forces numbered 96,000 troops (56,000 Italian, 40,000 German), 70 tanks, and around 500 planes. At the Battle of Anzio, the Allies numbered 36,000 troops, 2,300 vehicles, and 2,700 planes. The Axis forces numbered 20,000 German troops, 4,600 Italian troops, and 337 planes.

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response must state the number of Allied troops (150,000), tanks (179), artillery pieces (1,000+), and planes (1,500+) at the onset of the First Battle of El Alamein.

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response must state the number of Axis troops (96,000, including 56,000 Italian and 40,000 German), tanks (70), and planes (around 500) at the onset of the First Battle of El Alamein.

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response must state the number of Allied troops (36,000), vehicles (2,300), and planes (2,700) at the onset of the Battle of Anzio.

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response must state the number of Axis troops (20,000 German, 4,600 Italian) and planes (337) at the onset of the Battle of Anzio.

##   

  

## **‚ùå** **Personal preferences & overly prescriptive criteria**

Criteria should be based on the specific requirements of the prompt, essential information needed for a strong response, and extra details that elevate an okay response to a great one. Avoid including criteria based solely on personal preferences.

  

**Example Prompt**‚ùì: What are some good restaurants in san fransciso for a first date?

  

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should recommend a list of exactly 3 total restaurants, such as Foreign Cinema, Bix, and Lolinda

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The recommended restaurants should serve Italian food

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should recommend restaurants that are under $50 per person because I'm on a budget

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should recommend more than 1 restaurant, such as Foreign Cinema, Bix, and Lolinda

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The recommendations should be suitable for a first date, taking into account factors like a romantic ambiance and an environment that creates a positive first impression.

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The restaurants must be located in San Francisco

  

  

## **‚ùå Non-essential style / formatting preferences**

Do not include criteria that specify a certain writing style or formatting preference unless specifically requested in the prompt.

  

**Example Prompt**‚ùì: What are some good restaurants in san fransciso for a first date?

  

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The restaurant recommendations should be formatted as a bulleted list

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should be extremely concise

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should be written in a good format that is easy to read and conveys information effectively

##   

  

## **‚ùå Inaccurate criteria**

**Example Prompt**‚ùì: Share a snapshot of the most important accomplishments of the first president of the United States?

  

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: Share a biography of Benjamin Franklin that covers his early life, formative experiences, and political career.

This criteria is inaccurate. George Washington was the first president of the United States.

  

  

## **‚ùå Unnecessary criteria (e.g. related but not essential)**

**Example Prompt**‚ùì: What are some good restaurants in san fransciso for a first date?

  

**Bad Criteria** ‚ùå: The response should recommend where to go after dinner.

**Good Criteria** ‚úÖ: The response should recommend more than 1 restaurant, such as Foreign Cinema, Bix, and Lolinda

_The prompt does not request date ideas beyond dinner. It is not necessary for the model to include other date activities, so they should not be included._


##  Example 1 (Closed QA)**
**Prompt**

Refer to this poem:

  

##### **Dust of Snow**

The way a crow

Shook down on me

The dust of snow

From a hemlock tree

Has given my heart

A change of mood

And saved some part

Of a day I had rued.

‚Äì Robert Frost

  

Explain its significance, including how specific imagery relates to its meaning.

  

**Rubric Criteria**

‚ùå Bad criteria: The response must a range of interpretation of the meaning.

‚ùå Bad criteria: The response must note how imagery in the poem supports interpretations of its meaning.

‚úÖ Good criteria: The response covers at least a few different interpretations of the meaning of Dust of Snow, for example, the power of nature to uplift the spirt, how unexpected joy can spring from unexpected places, and the fleeting but meaningful nature of life.

‚úÖ Good criteria: The response covers at least several examples of how imagery in the poem supports different themes, for example, how the visual of a "dust of snow" signifies the cleansing, purifying potential of nature (hence the theme that nature has the power to uplift the spirit), or the visual of how a "crow" and "hemlock tree," two potentially ominous visuals, can actually be an uplifting symbol of how joy can spring from unexpected places.

--

**Explanation**

The "Bad criteria" are too vague. They are both missing examples of how the response could achieve the criteria (the first criteria does not provide examples of ways to interpret meaning from the poem. The second criteria does not provide examples as to how imagery in the poem helps convey specific themes.)

A reviewer cannot verify these criteria without finding and adding more information.

**Prompt:** I love to hike and would like to travel to south america. can you give me some suggestions of great hikes to do that take maximum 3 days?

  

**Selected Best Response:**

That sounds like an amazing adventure! South America is full of incredible hikes, and here are some of the best ones that fit within a 3-day limit:

### 1. Laguna 69 & Santa Cruz Trek (Partial) ‚Äì Peru

- Duration: 2-3 days
- Difficulty: Moderate to Challenging
- Highlights: Stunning blue glacial lake (Laguna 69), snow-capped peaks in the Cordillera Blanca, and breathtaking Andean landscapes.

### 2. Torres del Paine W Trek (Short Version) ‚Äì Chile

- Duration: 2-3 days
- Difficulty: Moderate
- Highlights: Towering granite peaks, turquoise lakes, and glaciers. You can do a shorter version by trekking to the Base of the Towers and back.

### 3. Quilotoa Loop (Short Version) ‚Äì Ecuador

- Duration: 2-3 days
- Difficulty: Moderate
- Highlights: Hike through indigenous villages and reach the stunning Quilotoa crater lake.

### 4. Cocora Valley & Los Nevados National Park ‚Äì Colombia

- Duration: 2-3 days
- Difficulty: Moderate
- Highlights: Towering wax palms (the tallest palm trees in the world), cloud forests, and a chance to explore the p√°ramo ecosystem.

### 5. Roraima Trek (Short Version) ‚Äì Venezuela

- Duration: 3 days (shorter version)
- Difficulty: Challenging
- Highlights: Otherworldly tabletop mountains, dramatic cliffs, and unique wildlife.

### 6. Cerro Castillo Trek (Short Version) ‚Äì Chile

- Duration: 2-3 days
- Difficulty: Moderate to Challenging
- Highlights: Patagonia‚Äôs rugged beauty, glacier-fed lakes, and jagged peaks.

### 7. Chapada Diamantina ‚Äì Brazil

- Duration: 2-3 days
- Difficulty: Moderate
- Highlights: Waterfalls, caves, and incredible panoramic views in this lesser-known Brazilian paradise.

**Response Rubric**

### **‚úÖ** Criteria 1: The response includes several examples of hikes in South America that can be completed in less than 3 days, such as Torres del Paine W Trek, Cerro Castillo Trek, and Chapada Diamantina

###   

‚úÖ Criteria 2: The response includes examples of hikes in a range of countries in South America, such as Venezuela, Chile and Brazil.

  

üî¥ Criteria 3: The response recommends the Chapada Diamantina hike in Brazil.

  

üî¥ Criteria 4: The response recommends hikes with caves and waterfalls.

**What was wrong with the Rubric?**

‚úÖ Criteria 1 and 2 are necessary for the response to cover in order to answer the prompt in a complete and logical way (recommending hikes in South America that can be completed in less than 3 days and recommending hikes in a range of countries).

  

üî¥ Criteria 3 and 4 are too prescriptive. Instead of writing criteria that explain what the response must achieve, providing examples and/or answers, these criteria pick two specific details from the prompt and present them as criteria.

Criteria 4 should have been phrased something like: "The response recommends hikes with a range of key physical features, such as caves, waterfalls, valleys and canyons." Criteria 3 is unnecessary and its intent is covered by Criteria 1.

  

Just because some relevant details are included in the best response does not mean they should be included in your criteria. If they aren't required to answer your prompt fully, they shouldn't be in your criteria.

## **Bad Rubric**

  

**_Example Prompt:_** Is it better to consume high amounts of protein before or after a workout, or both, for a morning long distance runner and strength trainer who burns a lot of calories?

  

**_Example Rubric Criteria:_**

- The response must state whether it is better to consume high amounts of protein before, after, or both for a workout involving long distance running and strength training that burns a lot of calories.
- The response should explain its reasoning behind whether it is better to consume protein before, after, or both for the workout by explaining either the benefits or disadvantages of consuming protein at these times.
- The response should take into consideration that the workout takes place in the morning by mentioning this point in the response and tailoring its explanation in some way to this factor.
- The response should consider what type of workout is being completed, which is long distance running and strength training, when determining whether protein should be consumed before, after, or both by mentioning the type of workout in the response and tailoring its explanation to this factor.
- The response should acknowledge that the workout burns a lot of calories by mentioning this factor in the response and including this point in its reasoning or explanations.

  

## **‚ùìWhy is this a bad rubric?**

- The rubric doesn't provide any information on the actual answer to the question (is before, after, or both the best time to consume high amounts of protein?). Instead, it just restates the question from the prompt in the rubric
- The rubric identifies various constraints from the prompt, but just states the the response should "consider" them without providing any information as to how those factors should actually influence the answer
- The rubric says numerous times that the response should "explain it's reasoning" without providing any information on what the actual reasoning should be

## ‚úÖ **Good Rubric**

  

**_Example Prompt:_** Is it better to consume high amounts of protein before or after a workout, or both, for a morning long distance runner and strength trainer who burns a lot of calories?

  

**_Example Rubric Criteria:_**

- The response should state that consuming protein both before and after a workout are beneficial, but is particularly important after a workout
- The response should explain that consuming protein after a workout is beneficial for recovery and muscle repair
- The response should explain that consuming protein before a workout can help provide sustained energy.
- The response should mention that morning workouts often follow an overnight fast, making pre-workout nutrition important to provide energy
- The response should mention that long-distance running burns significant calories, requiring both carbohydrate and protein intake
- The response should mention that strength training increases the need for protein to support muscle repair and growth.
- The response should mention that high-calorie expenditure increases the need for overall nutrition, emphasizing protein consumption after the workout to support recovery and prevent muscle loss.

  

## **‚úÖ Why is this a good rubric?**

- The rubric provides very clear and specific answers to the questions posed in the prompts
- The rubric considers all of the constraints from the prompt and provides specific information on how those factors should affect the answer within the response
- The rubric does not defer that the response must "explain its reasoning" - instead it provides criteria that very clearly explain the reasons behind all answers that should be provided
