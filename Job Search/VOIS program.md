### **2. Give me an example of where you have exceeded your own expectations.**

**Answer (STAR):**  
**Situation:** I was leading a project to implement a Security Operations Center (SOC) platform for a training environment.  
**Task:** The goal was to integrate Wazuh for monitoring, Shuffle for automation, and TheHive for case management.  
**Action:** I initially planned just to get them running and interconnected. However, I exceeded that by fully automating alert handling, building custom integrations, and creating detailed documentation to support others.  
**Result:** The solution worked seamlessly, reduced manual intervention significantly, and became a reference model for peers.

### **3. Tell me about a time when you've found a team or individual challenging to work with. How did you resolve the situation?**

**Answer (STAR):**  
**Situation:** In a university project to design a MIPS processor architecture, one teammate wasn’t meeting deadlines or responding to group messages.  
**Task:** We needed everyone's contributions to meet our project deadline.  
**Action:** I initiated a private, respectful conversation to understand their situation. I discovered they were overwhelmed with multiple responsibilities. I worked with the team to redistribute some tasks and set clear expectations.  
**Result:** The collaboration improved, and we completed the project successfully. This experience reinforced the importance of empathy and proactive communication in teamwork.

### **4. Tell me about a time when you've had to learn something quickly for a new project or task. What steps did you take?**

**Answer (STAR):**  
**Situation:** I had to design and implement a full adder circuit from the transistor level and build its layout for a class project.  
**Task:** I had never worked at that low level of abstraction before, and the deadline was tight.  
**Action:** I broke the learning into stages — understanding the logic, then the transistor-level design, then layout techniques. I used documentation and tutorials, and reached out to a friend who had done a similar task for guidance.  
**Result:** I completed the layout successfully and gained a much deeper understanding of circuit design. It was a great lesson in focused learning and using your network effectively.

### **5. Give me an example of an idea you came up with and were able to bring to life.**

**Answer (STAR):**  
**Situation:** While studying IoT, I noticed that hardware for IoT development was expensive, which was a challenge for me and other students.  
**Task:** I wanted to find a low-cost way for students to learn and practice IoT concepts.  
**Action:** I came up with the idea of combining Proteus simulations with IoT platforms like MasterOfThings. I tested the concept, developed example projects, and even created a small course to teach others how to do the same.  
**Result:** This approach helped me and several classmates save money and still gain hands-on IoT experience. It was well received and encouraged others to think creatively about learning resources.

### **6. Talk about your strengths.**

My key strengths are problem-solving, adaptability, and initiative. I enjoy tackling complex challenges, especially in areas like cybersecurity and system integration — for example, when implementing a SOC platform with tools like Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle. I'm also a quick learner, which helps me pick up new technologies or frameworks rapidly when needed. Another strength is collaboration — I communicate well with team members, value feedback, and know how to break down technical ideas so that everyone’s aligned. Overall, I bring a strong technical foundation combined with a proactive, solution-focused mindset.
